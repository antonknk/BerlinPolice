# BerlinPolice

For now, the repository hosts a scraper that retrieves the police announcement of Berlin's police force. This is the groundwork for a learning project that attempts to 

1. classify crimes into several categories (focus is on hate-crimes)
2. Retrieve the place and time a crime was committed
3. Analyse where and when hate crimes are likely to occur
4. Analyse how the reporting of crimes has changed over time (do changes in government or in police commissioner matter?)
